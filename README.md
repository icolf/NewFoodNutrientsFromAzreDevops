# NewFoodNutrients Project

### Introduction

I created this project with the goal of demonstrate some of my skills as a software engineer.  I also wanted to show how would I architech and build a new application or refactor an existing one based on my mentioned skills and knowledges.  
Is a very simple web application that covers a number of modern technologies and architechture patterns commonly used by top engineers and architechs in building cutting edge applications.

### NewFooNutrients Description

To be able to take the application to a complexity level in which I could usesome development tools and architecture principles, I decided to integrate into it some parent-child relations beween its objects.
So, I came out with a simple cooking recipes web application, where each recipe (parent) could contain one or multiple ingredients (children).  The application lets users adding, updating and deleting cooking recipes.
